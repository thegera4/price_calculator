# Price calculator

In this project, I practiced interfaces, structs, file system management, packages and go routine (concurrency), simulating a slow writing to json file process.
This is a simple CLI calculator, that allows you to know the total price (including tax)
of a certain item according to its price.

You just have to open the file "prices.txt" and input the prices there, line by line, and when you run the program (with "go run ."),
some JSON files will be created with the prices defined in the .txt file including certain tax rates (0%, 7%, 10%, and 15%).
